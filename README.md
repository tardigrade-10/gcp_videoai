# gcp_videoai

## Python code scripts for using google cloud platform's video intelligence api

## Steps:
1. Login in to your GCP account.
2. Go to [[service account]](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
3. generate service account key and download json file to local directory.
4. create cloud [[bucket]](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser) for storing files and accessing easily. 
(Storing files in cloud bucket is more of a convenient option for using gcp apis rather than storing files in local machine (fast results and easy access))
5. Fill path to downloaded 'service account key' and 'path to gcp uri' of uploaded file in the provided scripts.
6. Run.
