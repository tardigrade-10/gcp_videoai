## Python code scripts for using google cloud platform's video intelligence api

## Steps:
1. Login in to your GCP account.
2. Go to [[service account]](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
3. generate service account key and download json file to local directory.
4. create [[bucket]](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser) for storing files and accessing easily. 
(Storing files in bucket is an easier option for using apis rather than storing file in local machine (fast results and easy access))
5. Fill service account key and uri to uploaded file in the provided scripts.
